Modified to suit my needs.

# MacOS Maid
A simple shell script I run to keep my MacBook clean and patched.

## What It Does:
- Prompt For Password If Not Root 
- Deletes Saved Wireless Networks
- ~~Installs Needed System Updates~~
- Empties The Trash
- Deletes All System Logs
- Deletes The QuickLook files
- Updates And Cleans Homebrew
- Cleans Ruby
- ~~Removes All Docker Containers~~
- Purges Memory
- ~~Removes known_hosts file~~
- ~~Securely Wipe Freespace~~
- Upgrades things installed with `brew`.

## Usage:
- Review for your preferences and comment out options **You** dont want.
- Set `homessid` and `workssid` variable to stop from deleting those!
- `chmod +x maid.sh`
- `./maid.sh`

## Important Notice
I likely dont know what I am doing and this could be done faster, better and simpler some other way. These scripts could also break your MacBook and make you cry.
